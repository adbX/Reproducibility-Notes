\section{Introduction}

These are my research notes while working at NCSA.

\section{Reproducibility Terms}

I will be using the ACM terms for reproducibility \cite{acm-badging}. In order of increasing strength or rigor they are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Repeatability}: When a research team can get the same conclusions using the same experimental methods as previous
\item \textbf{Replicability}: When a separate research team can get the same conclusions using the same experimental methods as previous
\item \textbf{Reproducibility}: When a separate research team can get the same conclusions using a different experimental method as previous
\end{itemize}

There is some contention about these terms, I believe the biology people use different terms. \needcite

\section{Reproducibility Issues}

Here I'm trying to collect all the different issues which exist with reproducibility. I'm using it as a space to make sense of these issues as well as collect the references which make the case.

\complete

\subsection{Sociological Issues}

\begin{itemize}
\item Scrutinization
\item Competitive Advantage
\item Licensing
\item Monolithic codebases
\item Dirty code
\item \textbf{Some seem \textit{strange} given the published article}
\end{itemize}

\complete

\subsection{Software Issues}

\begin{itemize}
\item Numerical error
\item Transparent machine software/hardware failures
\item Hard-coded machine topologies
\item \textbf{Some of these are \textit{unavoidable}}
\end{itemize}

\complete

\subsection{Hardware Issues}

\begin{itemize}
\item Special hardware requirements
\item Silent Failures
\item \textbf{Some of these are \textit{unavoidable}}
\end{itemize}

\complete

\subsubsection{Specialized Hardware}

Here I'm detailing various specialized hardware I hear about which might hamper reproducibility efforts.

\begin{itemize}
\item Large Supercomputer (for large computing runs)
\item GPUs (Usually not hard to get, but still an obstacle)
\item FPGA
\item Neuromorphic Chips \cite{neuromorphic-chips-webarticle}
\end{itemize}

\complete

\subsubsection{Handling specialized hardware}

Results run on specialized hardware should still be replicable as long as an appropriate virtual machine or emulator is available for that architecture.

\complete

\subsection{Compatibility Issues}

DOES THIS SUBSECTION DESERVE ITS OWN SECTION??

Study compatibility is a serious problem which prevents the comparison of scientific studies when researchers do not agree on input formatting, output formatting, and general scientific workflow. Without this compatibility, major work must be done to allow apples to apples comparisons between scientific works.

To make matters worse, allowing scientists to steal a method from another scientist and use it in their IDE is currently impossible due to incompatibilities inherent in each application's assuredly divergent development lines. Thus solving the compatibility will be a great step forward towards allowing the three currently difficult workflows.

\section{Reproducibility Scandals}

Here, I'm going to collect together known scandals arrising from the lack of reproducibility.

\subsection{Medicine}

Medicine specific scandals

\begin{itemize}
\item 2004 GlaxoSmithKline Paxil uneffective \cite{dhb-zurich-hp}. \needcite
\item 2011 Bayer could only reproduce 17 of 67 published studies \cite{dhb-zurich-hp}. \needcite
\item 2012 Amgen could only reproduce 6 of 53 published cancer studies \cite{dhb-zurich-hp}. \needcite
\item 2014 Tamiflu review showed only small decrease in some smptoms \cite{dhb-zurich-hp}. \needcite
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physics}

Physics specific scandals.

\begin{itemize}
\item BICEP2 Gravitational Wave `discovery' \cite{dhb-zurich-hp}. \needcite
\end{itemize}

\complete

\section{Causation of Reproducibility problems}

This section summarizes why reproducibility is a problem in various fields and not other.
\complete

\section{Numerical Precision Issues}

This section summarizes issues related to numerical precisions. Whether it's an algorithm touted to be more precise, or a tool to optimize a program it will be found here.

In calculations which are sensitive to numerical precision, small errors may lead to large numerical problems such as taking the wrong branch in a conditional statement \cite{high-precision-arith-in-science}.

\complete

\subsection{IEEE floating point arithmetic}

Here, I review some properties of the IEEE floating point standard. I may later add some information about some fixed-point or alternative floating point implementations.

The IEEE 754 floating point standard \cite{ieee-754-2008,ieee-754-2008-redline} defines operation and exception details for the floating point number.

Each floating point number consists of a `mantissa' and an `exponent'. The mantissa ($m$) is a signed integer of precision $p$ and the exponent ($e$) is a signed integer with precision $e$. Each floating point number is also defined by a radix($b$) which can either be 2(binary) or 10(decimal). Each floating point number then has a value $m\cdot b^e$. Table \ref{tab:float-par} defines these parameters for each defined binary type.

\FloatBarrier
\begin{table}[t]
	\caption{Floating point variable parameters for each binary (radix 2) defined type. All taken from \cite{ieee-754-2008}.} \label{tab:float-par}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\hline
bit-width & 32 & 64 & 128 \\
\hline
specification name & binary32 & binary64 & binary128 \\
\hline
colloquial name & \texttt{float} & \texttt{double} & \texttt{quad} \\
\hline
precision & 24 & 53 & 113 \\
\hline
exponent precision & 8 & 11 & 15 \\
\hline
equivalent decimal precision & ~7 digits & ~16 digits & ~34 digits \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Normalization}

A common way of expressing a floating point number is like this: $\pm\beta^e\times. d_1 d_2 \ldots d_t$ with $d_1 \neq 0$ for \textit{normalized} numbers. when $y$ is less than $\beta^{emin}$, $d_1$ cannot be non-zero and so we have sub-normal numbers \cite{higham-numerical-accuracy-and-stability}.

\subsubsection{Rounding modes}

From libc and ieee \cite{gnu-libc-rounding,ieee-754-2008}, we have four rounding modes. \cite{gnu-libc-rounding} says that fpu calculations occur at higher precision, and then the value is stored in the specified data width where rounding occurs. I haven't found the statement in \cite{ieee-754-2008} which says this.

\begin{itemize}
\item Round to nearest (default)
\item Round to $+\infty$
\item Round to $-\infty$
\item Round to 0
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Machine Epsilon}

From lemma 2.1 on page 37 of \cite{higham-numerical-accuracy-and-stability}, The spacing between a normalized floating point number $x$ and an adjacent normalized floating point number is at least $\beta^{-1}\epsilon|x|$ and at most $\epsilon|x|$ \cite{higham-numerical-accuracy-and-stability}. This also means that the largest error between an infinitely precise number, and it's nearest neighbor is $\epsilon/2 = \beta^{-(p-1)}/2$. This value is known as the machine epsilon.

Another definition: Machine epsilon is defined as the smallest number that, when added to one, yields a result different from one. This is $b^{-(p-1)}$ and $\epsilon/2$ for the round-to-nearest procedure.

\subsubsection{Known numerical anomalies}

Bailey goes through a great discussion of known numerical anomalies here \cite{dhb-numerical-bugs}. I'm going to talk about a couple of them.

\begin{itemize}
\item Language-based difficulties
\begin{itemize}
\item code constant translation to lower precision types than those on the rhs of equations.
\item Expression evaluation to the precision of only the operand types and not the type on the rhs of the equation.
\end{itemize}
\item Avoidable Numerical Anomalies
\begin{itemize}
\item Conditional branches with floating-point comparison which may fail to hold
\item error accumulation from summation of small numbers
\end{itemize}
\item Unavoidable Numerical Anomalies
\begin{itemize}
\item Large equations or systems of equations are demanding numerically.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reproducibility Attributes}

This section discusses the reproducibility attributes present in the IEEE 754 standard. \cite{ieee-754-2008}

\subsection{Scientific Problems needing special precision}

A number of problems need special scientific precision. David Bailey did a great job laying this out\cite{high-precision-arith-in-science,dhb-zurich-hp}. I reproduce his table from \cite{dhb-zurich-hp} as Table \ref{tab:precision} to give an idea of the gamut.

\end{table}
\FloatBarrier

MINOS \needcite software for biochemistry contains precision problems \cite{dhb-zurich-hp}.

\subsection{Solutions to reduction error issues}

Two techniques which can be used to solve reduction error are to either enforce an ordering to the summation. This can be done by creating a unique id for each element of the sum, and guarenteeing that these ids are identical each run and making sure that the summation sums the id'd elements the same way each time. Another is to use the technique outlined here: \cite{repro-fast-sum}.

There are some techniques to test whether your program has numerical precision difficulties. You can for instance, change the rounding mode. If the program's result varies wildly, you know there is a precision problem, but it does nothing to clear this up \cite{dhb-numerical-bugs}. You can add an adjustable 'fuzz' to a computation to see whether this affects the results offered. This can prove numerical instability \cite{dhb-numerical-bugs}.

\subsection{Software implementing arbitrary precision floating point}

Here I collect packages which implement arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic in various ways. These packages were discovered in \cite{high-precision-arith-in-science}.

\begin{itemize}
\item ARPREC (Arbitrary, pre-set precision level) \needcite
\item DDFUN (double double precision) \needcite
\item FMLIB/FMZM90 (low-level multiple-precision libarary) \needcite
\item GMP (multiple-precision library) \needcite
\item Predicates (Specialized package for computational geometry) \needcite
\item QD (double double and quad double arithmetic. Faster than arbitrary precision libraries when only double double or quad double precision is sufficient) \needcite
\item MPFR/MPFR++ (multi-precision library with exact rounding \needcite
\item MPFUN90 (ARPREC equivalent entirely in fortran90) \cite{mpfun}
\item VPA (arbitrary precision library for fortran) \needcite
\end{itemize}

From \cite{dhb-zurich-hp}, we have:

\begin{itemize}
\item CORVETTE \needcite
\end{itemize}

Using high-precision software increases runtimes. double-double Takes 5 times longer than 64-bit arithmetic, 25 times longer with quad-double, and 50 times for 100-digit arithmetic. Computational cost scales as $p^2$ up to about 1000 digits then costs $p\log p$ if you're using FFT-based multiplication. \cite{high-precision-arith-in-science} (\needcite for FFFT-based multiplication)

\subsection{Program Precision Optimizers}

These tools analyze a program's operation in some way and produce recommendations about data types or run conditions which will preserve or increase a program's numerical precision while also improving or largely preserving a programs performance.

\begin{itemize}
\item BLAME Analysis \cite{blame-analysis}
\item PRECIMONIOUS \needcite
\end{itemize}

A few examples of applications which have benefitted from these techniques or detailed studies include climate modelling, supernova simulations, coulomb n-body simulations, studies of the fine-structure constant, E-M scattering theory, vortex sheet roll-up (fluid dynamics) simulations, computational geometry, compuational number theory, experimental math (including the discovery of the BBP $\pi$ formula, quantum field theory (Using PSLQ computations (More info on PSLQ here \cite{dhb-numerical-bugs}) (All of the previous fields are from \cite{high-precision-arith-in-science}).

Ising integrals, tanh-sinh integration algorithm, box-integrals, minimal polynomials, algebraic numbers in poisson potential functions \needcite \cite{dhb-zurich-hp}.

\subsubsection{BLAME Analysis}

This tool is created from LLVM and analyzes code passed through it for operations which can be run at reduced precision. \cite{blame-analysis}

\complete?

\subsection{Algorithmic concepts dealing with numerical precision}

Condition number, the condition number of a function with respect to an argument measures how much the output value of the function can change for a small change in the input argument. \needcite

\subsection{Theoretical Tools to approach the problem of numerical precision}

Here I go over some theoretical tools to confront numerical precision issues. The idea is that some or all of the ideas in this section can be turned on computational code to produce uncertainty estimates of their results.

\complete

\subsubsection{Interval arithmetic}

This technique focuses on calculating everything with an interval rather than a single number. This way the uncertainty interval is propogated all the way to the end of the calculation. (There is a wiki article but I need to find a real source.) \needcite

Unfortunately, it's runtime cost is enormous \cite{dhb-numerical-bugs}.

\section{Goals for reproducibility}

I want to make the following methods more easily executable. Replicability and Compatibility will be huge steps towards making this happen.

\complete

\subsection{Method Appropriation}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{A} is working on airfoil using method \boldmath$\alpha$, but sim has a problem
\item \textbf{B} publishes method $\beta$ which claims to fix said problem
\item \textbf{A} reads \textbf{B}'s paper
\item \textbf{A} downloads \textbf{B}'s materials, verifies the result
\item \textbf{A} then uses method $\beta$ to solve their problem
\item \textbf{A} publishes their airfoil citing \textbf{B} as simulation method
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Method Tweaking}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{A} needs to simulate a large protein to find binding sites
\item \textbf{A} finds method \boldmath$\beta$ by \textbf{B} for simulating large proteins efficiently, but doesn't find binding sites.
\item \textbf{A} download's \textbf{B}'s materials, verifies the result
\item \textbf{A} adds code to find binding sites to $\beta$ producing method $\alpha$
\item \textbf{A} publishes method $\alpha$ citing \textbf{B}'s method $\beta$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Method Improvement}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Performing lattice QCD, \textbf{A} finds method \boldmath$\beta$ by \textbf{B}.
\item \textbf{A} spots mistake in method $\beta$ from article
\item \textbf{A} downloads \textbf{B}'s materials, verifies the result
\item \textbf{A} changes $\beta$ creating method $\alpha$ solving mistake
\item \textbf{A} runs method $\alpha$ verifying better agreement with experimentally measured values
\item \textbf{A} publishes $\alpha$ citing \textbf{B} about this change
\end{enumerate}

\section{Reproducibility Software}

Here I'm collecting a list of all reproducibility software I have encountered. I'll discuss each in turn hitting what they offer and what they lack. Any specific system which doesn't have it's own section means I haven't tried it or don't know enough about it to say anything.

\subsection{Containers}

These techniques utilize a namespacing system to allow native execution of code and virtualization of OS without the need for a hypervisor.

\begin{itemize}
\item Docker \cite{Docker}
\item Vagrant \needcite
\item Singularity \cite{Singularity}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Virtual Machines}

These techniques use a hypervisor to run a logically separate virtual machine on a host machine. These tend to be slower, but as hardware vendors add support for virtualization technology to their chipsets they are getting closer to native performance.

\begin{itemize}
\item VMWare \needcite
\item Virtual Box \needcite
\item KVM \needcite

\subsection{Workflow Managers}

These softwares purport to handle all of our scientific workflow needs. They handle your source code, build your application, run it and compile the paper from the results produced. Some workflows may not fit, but they are working hard to make sure that it doesn't stay that way.

\subsection{Watchers}

\begin{itemize}
\item ReproZip \cite{reprozip} \Read \categorize
\end{itemize}

\complete

\subsubsection{In-Practice}

The only one of these schemes which I've tried so far is ReproZip \cite{reprozip}. I ran a simple \texttt{htop} command on my laptop and tried to run it on the campus cluster where \texttt{htop} doesn't exist. This failed, but I didn't record the error that occured.

\complete

\subsection{Advanced Package and Environment Management}

These programs take control of the execution environment while also staying out of the way by using existing mechanisms to do their magic. For example, using \texttt{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} or \texttt{RUNPATH} instead of more complex stuff like userspace namespacing like what containers do.

\begin{itemize}
\item Spack \cite{Spack}
\item Nix \needcite \expand

\subsection{Company interest and Lives}

The great article \cite{killed-by-code} discusses the danger of having propietary code running on medical implants. These implants control people's bodily functions or may be relied on to restore normal function in the event of failure. This code can often have bugs inside which can lead to death for the user if serious enough.

Not all users are capable of reading and understanding code in these devices, but those who do have a large interest in making sure the code is as bug-free as possible. Allowing knoweldgeable users to view the code and make bug-fixes would make these devices much safer.

\section{Statistical Tests}

This section outlines a few statistical tests which we have used in our analysis.

\subsection{Wilcoxon Ranked Sum Test}

This test was used in our first JCP paper to test whether the informed and uninformed groups were behaving in a statistically different way. \cite{doi:10.1080/01621459.1972.10481279,R-wilcoxon-test}

\subsection{David H. Bailey}

David Bailey concerns himself with numerical precision issues. He has produced a nice summary of scientific problems which require greater than normal precision \cite{high-precision-arith-in-science,dhb-zurich-hp}. He has also been involved in the creation of tools to help find parts of a program which can be run at lower precision ostensibly to limit program execution time\cite{blame-analysis}.
